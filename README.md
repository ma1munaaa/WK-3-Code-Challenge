# Movie Ticket Booking Project

This is a simple movie ticket booking project that allows users to view a list of movies and their details, such as title, runtime, description, showtime, and available seats. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The list of movies will be displayed with their respective details.
4. Scroll through the list to view the available movies.
5. The movie details include the movie title, runtime, description, showtime, and the number of available seats.
6. Select the movie you want to watch and check the available seats.
7. Book your ticket based on the available seats shown.
8. Enjoy the movie!

The movie data is stored in the `db.json` file. Each movie has properties such as `id`, `title`, `runtime`, `description`, `showtime`, `capacity`, and `tickets_sold`. The `poster` property contains the URL to the movie poster image.
